# Task Manager App

## Description
This is a simple task manager application built with React. It allows users to:
- Add, delete, and edit tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Set priorities for tasks (High, Medium, Low).
- Sort tasks based on their priority.
- Store tasks in local storage to persist between sessions.

## Setup and Launch

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js and npm installed on your computer.

### Installation:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-manager-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd task-manager-app
```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
Your task manager app should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

## Assumptions Made During Development
i) Local storage is used to persist tasks, which means data will be saved between sessions but will be cleared if the browser cache is cleared.

ii) The app assumes the user has basic knowledge of task management concepts (e.g., priority levels, completion toggle).

iii) The UI design is kept simple for ease of use and does not include advanced animations or styling frameworks.
